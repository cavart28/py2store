# py2store
Interfacing with stored data through python.

Listing, reading, writing, and deleting data from/in a structured data source/target, 
through a common interface, as agnostic as possible of the physical particularities. 

It would be tempting to coin py2store as ya(p)orm (yet another (python) object-relational mapping), 
but that would be wrong. The intent of py2store is not to map objects to db entries, 
but rather to offer a consistent interface for basic storage operations. 
In that sense, py2store is more akin to an implementation of the data access object (DAO) pattern. 
Of course, the difference between ORM and DAO can be blurry, so all this should be taken with a grain of salt.

Advantages and disadvantages such abstractions are easy to search and find.

Most data interaction mechanisms can be satisfied by a subset of the collections.abc interfaces.
For example, one can use python's collections.Mapping interface for any key-value storage, making the data access 
object have the look and feel of a dict, instead of using other popular method name choices such for 
such as read/write, load/dump, etc. 
One of the dangers there is that, since the DAO looks and acts like a dict (but is not) a user might underestimate 
the running-costs of some operations.


# Use cases

## Interfacing reads

How many times did someone share some data with you in the form of a zip of some nested folders 
whose structure and naming choices are fascinatingly obscure? And how much time do you then spend to write code 
to interface with that freak of nature? Well, one of the intents of py2store is to make that easier to do. 
You still need to understand the structure of the data store and how to deserialize these datas into python 
objects you can manipulate. But with the proper tool, you shouldn't have to do much more than that.

## Thinking about storage later, if ever

You have a new project or need to write a new app. You'll need to store stuff and read stuff back. 
Stuff: Different kinds of resources that your app will need to function. Some people enjoy thinking 
of how to optimize that aspect. I don't. I'll leave it to the experts to do so when the time comes. 
Often though, the time is later, if ever. Few proof of concepts and MVPs ever make it to prod. 

So instead, I'd like to just get on with the business logic and write my program. 
So what I need is an easy way to get some minimal storage functionality. 
But when the time comes to optimize, I shouldn't have to change my code, but instead just change the way my 
DAO does things. What I need is py2store.

# Easy Examples

Below, we make a default store and demo a few basic operations on it.
The default store uses a dict as it's backend persister. 
A dict is neither really a backend, nor a persister. But it helps to try things out with no
footprint.

```
from py2store.base import Store

s = Store()
assert list(s) == []
s['foo'] = 'bar'  # put 'bar' in 'foo'
assert 'foo' in s  # check that 'foo' is in (i.e. a key of) s
assert s['foo'] == 'bar'  # see that the value that 'foo' contains is 'bar'
assert list(s) == ['foo']  # list all the keys (there's only one)
assert list(s.items()) == [('foo', 'bar')]  # list all the (key, value) pairs
assert list(s.values()) == ['bar']  # list all the values
assert len(s) == 1  # Number of items in my store
s['another'] = 'item'  # store another item
assert len(s) == 2  # Now I have two!
assert list(s) == ['foo', 'another']  # here they are
```

There's nothing fantastic in the above code. 
I've just demoed some operations on a dict.
But it's exactly this simplicity that py2store aims for. 
You can now replace the `s = Store()` with `s = AnotherStore(...)` where `AnotherStore` 
now uses some other backend that could be remote or local, could be a database, or any 
system that can store `something` (the value) `somewhere` (the key).

You can choose from an existing store (e.g. local files, for AWS S3, for MongoDB) or 
quite easily make your own (more on that later).

And yet, it will still look like you're talking to a dict. This not only means that you can 
talk to various storage systems without having to actually learn how to, but also means 
that the same business logic code you've written can be reused with no modification. 

But py2store offers more than just a simple consistent facade to **where** you store things, 
but also provides means to define **how** you do it.

In the case of key-value storage, the "how" is defined on the basis of the keys (how you reference) 
the objects you're storing and the values (how you serialize and deserialize those objects).
 

Take a look at the following example, that adds a layer of key conversion to a store.

```
class PrefixedKeyStore(Store):
    prefix = ''
    def _id_of_key(self, key):
        return self.prefix + key  # prepend prefix before passing on to store
    def _key_of_id(self, _id):
        if not _id.startswith(self.prefix):
            raise ValueError(f"_id {_id} wasn't prefixed with {self.prefix}")
        else:
            return _id[len(self.prefix):]  # don't show the user the prefix
```

Try it out:

```    
s = PrefixedKeyStore()
s.prefix = '/ROOT/'
assert list(s) == []
s['foo'] = 'bar'  # put 'bar' in 'foo'
assert 'foo' in s  # check that 'foo' is in (i.e. a key of) s
assert s['foo'] == 'bar'  # see that the value that 'foo' contains is 'bar'
assert list(s) == ['foo']  # list all the keys (there's only one)
assert list(s.items()) == [('foo', 'bar')]  # list all the (key, value) pairs
assert list(s.values()) == ['bar']  # list all the values
assert len(s) == 1  # Number of items in my store
s['another'] = 'item'  # store another item
assert len(s) == 2  # Now I have two!
assert list(s) == ['foo', 'another']  # here they are
```

Q: That wasn't impressive! It's just the same as the first Store. What's this prefix all about?

A: The prefix thing is hidden, and that's the point. You want to talk the "relative" (i.e "prefix-free")
language, but may have the need for this prefix to be prepended to the key before persisting the data
and that prefix to be removed before being displayed to the user. 
Think of working with files. Do you want to have to specify the root folder every time you store something
or retrieve something?

Q: Prove it!

A: Okay, let's look under the hood at what the underlying store (a dict) is dealing with:

```
assert list(s.store.items()) == [('/ROOT/foo', 'bar'), ('/ROOT/another', 'item')]
```

You see? The keys that the "backend" is using are actually prefixed with `"/ROOT/"`

Let's now demo serialization and deserialization. 

Say we want to deserialize any text we stored by appending `"hello "` to everything stored.

```
class MyFunnyStore(Store):
    def _obj_of_data(self, data):
        return f'hello {data}'
```

```
s = MyFunnyStore()
assert list(s) == []
s['foo'] = 'bar'  # put 'bar' in 'foo'
assert 'foo' in s  # check that 'foo' is in (i.e. a key of) s
assert s['foo'] == 'hello bar'  # see that the value that 'foo' contains is 'bar'
assert list(s) == ['foo']  # list all the keys (there's only one)
assert list(s.items()) == [('foo', 'hello bar')]  # list all the (key, value) pairs
assert list(s.values()) == ['hello bar']  # list all the values
```

In the following, we want to serialize our text by upper-casing it (and see it as such) 
when we retrieve the text.

```
class MyOtherFunnyStore(Store):
    def _data_of_obj(self, data):
        return data.upper()
``` 
    
```
s = MyOtherFunnyStore()
assert list(s) == []
s['foo'] = 'bar'  # put 'bar' in 'foo'
assert 'foo' in s  # check that 'foo' is in (i.e. a key of) s
assert s['foo'] == 'BAR'  # see that the value that 'foo' contains is 'bar'
assert list(s) == ['foo']  # list all the keys (there's only one)
assert list(s.items()) == [('foo', 'BAR')]  # list all the (key, value) pairs
assert list(s.values()) == ['BAR']  # list all the values
```

In the last to serialization examples, we only implemented one way transformations. 
In most cases though, you will need two way transformations, specifying how the object 
should be serialized to be stored, and how it should be deserialized to get your object back.
